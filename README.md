# Pose game
UAL: Creative Computing Institute

By me, Stuart Leitch!

Class taught by Phoenix Perry

This is an interactive game to try out using Tensorflow JS to load a pretrained model and use it in realtime interactions.

The game itself is kind of shit. Squares will light up and you're supposed to touch them. By touching them, they turn transparent and reveal the image underneath. What's the image? Just see!

~~Step 1: Create background image~~

~~Step 2: Turn camera on~~

~~Step 3: Feed frames to Posenet~~

~~Step 4: Get coordinates of nose~~

Step 5: Draw nose position shape on the canvas

Step 6: Draw square shapes 

Step 7: If "touch" a square, it fades away and you see... the man behind the mask
